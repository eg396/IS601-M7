This is a small program mainly built to Dockerize the 'main.py' file.
Included are the files needed, as well as two screenshots that prove the functionality of the programs.
Additionally, GitHub actions have verified the functionality.
You won't be able to steal my Docker info, however, as I kept those secret.
